1. What is the general trend in the curve?
Increasing with a positive slope. There's usually a dip at the beginning, then a steady-ish increase to the top-right corner.

2. Are there parts of the curve that appear to be noisier than others?  Why?
The beginning definitely seems pretty noisy. In the first few trials the noise mainly came from the 20-80 percent range, with a lot of jagged peaks. This was probably due to the uneven distribution of data, and continual improvement. The trials are slightly randomized, so the curve isn't completely smooth. 

3. How many trials do you need to get a smooth curve?
I tried various large values, and saw that 10,000 trials led to a pretty smooth curve. 

4. Try different values for C (by changing LogisticRegression(C=10**-10)).  What happens?  If you want to know why this happens, see this Wikipedia page as well as the documentation for LogisticRegression in scikit-learn.
The range of accuracies(the y-axis) changes. The larger C is, the larger the accuracies get.
